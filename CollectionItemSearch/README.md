### v1.0.0

Addon remade from CollectionSearchFix


Based on code in collection.lua from patch 151622.ipf

This addon fixes the search function, allowing searches for collection name and stat, while adding searches by item name

Although the search feature has been fixed on iToS, you still need an addon to search by item name, which this addon enables
